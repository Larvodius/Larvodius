- ⚡ Fun fact: In the beginning (17 years ago...), I started a degree im Math Applied to Business. Loved the C++ classes I took (forgot everything since then) , but left one year latter to graduate in Musical Education. Met my wife in this course. Took a master's degree in Science, Technology and Society. Working as an Ars tacher in public education for 8 years. Studying CS and coding now. The fun fact is: In the end, I´m on the beginning! (:
